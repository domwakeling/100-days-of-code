# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished 'Rogue(like) Adventure' (Project 15 on
  FreeCodeCamp).

**Thoughts:** Code is a little messy in places and could do with being
re-factored. The dungeon generator (Dungeon class) could be appropriate for
putting out as open-source (or at least posting on GitHub!)
