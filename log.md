# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished 'Rogue(like) Adventure' (Project 15 on
  FreeCodeCamp).

**Thoughts:** Code is a little messy in places and could do with being
re-factored. The dungeon generator (Dungeon class) could be appropriate for
putting out as open-source (or at least posting on GitHub!)

### Day 2: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started work on FreeCodeCamp Project 16 (Bar
  Chart). Ran through tutorials at Mike Bostock's site
  ([part1 ](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/1) and
  [part 2](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/2)), trialled in CodePen, and added a
  third chart pulling and visualising the FCC-provided JSON set.

**Thoughts:** Know very little about ```<svg>``` elements in HTML, need to do some
additional research on this; seems likely there will be more of this coming up!

### Day 3: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished working on FreeCodeCamp Project 16 (Bar
  Chart). Main changes implemented:

  - added vertical & horizontal axis
  - added vertical scale (requiring reversing of scale domain so that
  the numbers ran true, and necessitating changes to height and transforms for the bars)
  - added horizontal scale
  - added tooltips
  - added title and legend for vertical axis
  - styling including changing colours of axis, tick-marks and scales to match dark background

Primary resources used was the tutorial at Mike Bostock's site
  ([bar chart part 3](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/3)) together with [D3 Tricks & Tips](https://leanpub.com/d3-t-and-t-v4/read) by Malcolm Maclean.

**Thoughts:** Seems like just getting started with D3 (and as noted yesterday, don't really have the background in ```svg```). In the absence of tutorials/challenges at FreeCodeCamp (which I think are coming) have found some other resources which I'll be looking at in coming days to improve knowledge.
