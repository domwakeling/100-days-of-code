# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished 'Rogue(like) Adventure' (Project 15 on
  FreeCodeCamp).

**Thoughts:** Code is a little messy in places and could do with being
re-factored. The dungeon generator (Dungeon class) could be appropriate for
putting out as open-source (or at least posting on GitHub!)

### Day 2: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started work on FreeCodeCamp Project 16 (Bar
  Chart). Ran through tutorials at Mike Bostock's site
  ([part1](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/1) and
  [part2](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/2)), trialled in CodePen, and added a
  third chart pulling and visualising the FCC-provided JSON set.

**Thoughts:** Know very little about ```<svg>``` elements in HTML, need to do some
additional research on this; seems likely there will be more of this coming up!
